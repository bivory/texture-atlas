=== About ===

This is a simple command line tool that takes a list of PNG image files and creates a somewhat optimized texture atlas. It might rotate images if that will allow the texture atlas to be smaller.



=== Usage ===

USAGE:
   ./texture-atlas  [-i <string>] ...  [-q] [-y <pixels>] [-x <pixels>] [-o
                    <string>] [--] [--version] [-h] <PNG file path> ...

Where:
   -i <string>,  --info_writers <string>  (accepted multiple times)
     Atlas information writers: csv

   -q,  --quiet
     Suppress processing information output.

   -y <pixels>,  --out_height <pixels>
     Maximum output atlas image's height.

   -x <pixels>,  --out_width <pixels>
     Maximum output atlas image's width.

   -o <string>,  --out_name <string>
     Output atlas image's file name.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <PNG file path>  (accepted multiple times)
     (required)  List of the image filenames.


   Creates a texture atlas from a list of PNG files.

Ex:
./texture-atlas image/128x64.png  image/64x128.png
